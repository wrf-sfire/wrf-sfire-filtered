WRF-Fire is a coupled atmosphere-wildland fire model combining WRF and
fire model code, released and distributed by NCAR as a part of WRF. 
This repository contains a development version of WRF-Fire with the latest
features and bug fixes, and additional utilities.
The code from this repository is submitted to WRF release from time to time.

For terms and conditions see the file license.txt

Documentation is in progress. Current drafts of the technical documentation and
user's guide can be found at

We hope you find the code useful. Please let us know if we can help. But
do us a favor and before you ask a question (such as, what is git?) 
please google first. You may need to find a local guru for Linux questions.

If you find this code useful please acknowledge our work by citing the paper
[1]. For the description of the fire code, see the sections
"Fireline propagation model", "Coupling ﬁre and weather models", and
"Level-set-based wildland fire model".  The fire model is based on [2] 
but not all features from [2] are implemented here yet. The preprint [3]
describes the code as of WRF release 3.3 planned in Spring 2011 and 
this repository as of early November 2010. The paper [4] is just an
extended abstract but it mentions few more advanced features.

Thank you for using WRF-Fire!

SUPPORT

For support please subscribe to the wrf-fire mailing list at NCAR at

or see http://www.openwfm.org/wiki/WRF-Fire_user_support 

NOTE: Answers to any questions may be copied or summarized to the wrf-fire list
and/or the wiki.


COMPILERS

Tested on linux/ifort/gcc, linux/pgi, linux/g95 (all x86-64), and mac/g95. 
Mac will not run optimized or real data, though. ifort for Linux can be 
downloaded from Intel free for non-commercial use. gfortran is not included 
because gfortran currently cannot compile wrf.


SETUP 

We strongly recommend using git not a tar file to download the code
so that you can get updates easily and also keep your changes. 
You will probably need to install git.  A current version (now 1.6) 
recommended. You may need to install git from sources.

Download NETCDF and install. The curent version is 4.0 Some hints: 
Set the environment variables CC FC and F90 to your compilers. 
Set the install location by something like 
./configure --prefix=/opt/netcdf 
(Of course, use your own location)
Set the environment variable to the top level netcdf directory like:
setenv NETCDF /opt/netcdf
(Of course, replace the path by your location of NETCDF above)

Local developers can source env.csh with setup for some local machines where
NETCDF is already installed.


DOWNLOAD SITES

The code can be downloaded from http://github.com/jbeezley/wrf-fire/ by

 	 git clone git://github.com/jbeezley/wrf-fire.git

You can see current activities, branches, and download the code also from

         http://repo.or.cz/git-browser/by-commit.html?r=wrffire.git

Developers with write access get the code and submit changes by 

         git clone ssh://user@math.ucdenver.edu/home/grads/jbeezley/wrf-fire.git

where "user" is your username at math.ucdenver.edu.


BRANCHES

Use the code from the master branch as it is the only stable one. Use other
branches only if instructed by the developers. We recommend to set up your own
branch for your changes and merge master into it when it is updated.
See doc/README_git.txt


BUILDING

 
cd wrfv2_fire
./configure # select an option for your computer architecture/compilers
	    # If you are trying to get this working on different
	    # compilers, try copying a section close to your case
            # in arch/configure_new.defaults to the end of that file
            # and modifying to suit your needs... good luck.
./compile em_fire >& compile.log

This will take a while.  Make sure that compile.log contains 
no errors.  ("grep Error compile.log" shouldn't return anything).


RUNNING

cd test/em_fire/small 
./ideal.exe >& ideal.log (this creates file wrfinput_d01, needs to be done only
when input_sounding changes)
./wrf.exe

This runs an "idealized" problem. 
For RUNNING ON REAL DATA see doc/README_wps.txt


STANDALONE FIRE MODEL TEST

With ifort:

cd phys
./ifmake clean
./ifmake model_test

Without the clean between different kind of builds nothing will work.
There is g95make for g95.
With other compilers, try someting like 

    make -f testmakefile FC=your fortran compiler

See wrfv2_fire/phys/README_jm.txt for more info.

NOTE: maintaining the standalone model is low priority and it may not work.
