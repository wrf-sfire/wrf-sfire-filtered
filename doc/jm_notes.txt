subroutine fire_winds: physics atm grid midpoints -> atm grid corners

subroutine fire_topography atm grid topo -> fire grid
subroutine fire_startup: separated into operations on fire only
subroutine fire_ln: got rid of extra atm args

6/13/07

subroutine fire_init: got rid of some extra atm args (its and so on)
        ditto fire_ds, fire_igs
nfrx, nfry: ratio atm/fire grid; no business in fire routines
        took out of fire_startup, fire_stat, fire_ln, fire_ds, fire_igs
subroutine fire_burn_fcn: took extra atm args out
found use of atm grid in fire_init fire_tr

I have removed unnecesary atmospheric grid related arguments from all fire
routines. I have put back grnhfx,grnqfx,canhfx,canqfx on the argument list of
cawfee so that they are now passed to wrf, but wrf does not use them for
anything (I tested that).

Nothing I did so far should have resulted in any change to the code behavior,
the output from wrf.exe is still exactly the same.

The following subroutines still use the atm grid:

fire_winds despite the name does NOT interpolate to fire grid.
Instead it interpolates only from midpoints of mesh cells to corners on atmospheric grid.

fire_topography (a part of fire_startup I split off) interpolates terrain
height to arrays zf and zsf (fire grid). This is used only in one place, in
fire_tr to get "integer height of fuel". It is NOT used to determine the
terrain gradient.

fire_tr interpolates wind from corners of atmospheric grid only at the few points
it needs. It also uses wind at several grid heights and interpolates
gradient topography from atmospheric grid (array zs). The wind is never
interpolated to  the whole fire grid. This is good for efficiency.
But the double interpolation (from midpoints to corners, then to selected points in fire_tr) can only decrease accuracy.

fire_init uses atmospheric grid numbers for unclear (historical) reasons.

fire_tendency needs to modify variables on the atm grid, of course.

fire_emissions has unclear function and is never called.

At some point in near future we'll have to decide where to draw the line to
isolate the fire model (=specify what the interface is) so that we can play
with a replacement. In particular we'll have to decide if to keep the
atmospheric grid in the fire model interface and in which form. At the moment
the atm grid is too tightly interwoven in the fire model and I cannot take it
out without probably changing model behavior by different rounding.

cawfe args kfds,kfde,kfms,kfme never used
all grids dimensioned in cells not nodes?

FR: mesh bounds on input to cawfe:
ids        1      42       1      41       1      42
ims       -3      46       1      41      -3      46
its        1      41       1      40       1      41
idfs       1     420       1      41       1     420

In the example I run I have
ids=        1  jds=    42
idfs=       1  jdfs=   420
so that would appear that the 1st cell of atm grid covers the same
location as the first 10 cells of the fire grid, etc. (for simplicity
I will talk about i only, j is similar)

But all fire computation go from
   if_st = MAX( (its-1)*nfrx+1, ids*nfrx+1   )
to
   if_en = MIN( (ite)*nfrx    , (ide-1)*nfrx )
and similarly for j. In this example this is from 11 to 410.
Why? Anything bad happens if I run computation everywhere? There is a
comment in the code about tiles and butting that I do not comprehend.

But when computing fluxes
      DO 96 i = if_st+1,if_en-1   !start of I,J fuel grid physics
         ib = INT(FLOAT((i-2)/nfrx+2)+ep)

where j=fire cell index, jb=atm cell index
for the low bound i=if_st+1=12 this gives (i-2)/nfrx+2=3 ib=3
the upper bound   i=if_en-1=409 (i-2)/nfrx+2=42.7 ib=42

OK so the atmospheric grid is 1:42 by 1:42 (ids:ide,jds:jde)
so one would expect with ratio 10 the fire grid should be
1:420 by 1:420
assuming that for some reason one would want to solve on a smaller domain
then 11:410 on fire grid is 2:41 on atm grid

when we are passed 1:42 by 1:42 at domain and matching 1:420 by 1:420
fire domain, why don't we just compute with them but only with a part?

why is the summation on domain by 1 less on all sides?

We are passed
!  cen_lat        latitude of the center of the fire domain
!  cen_lon        longitude of the center of the fire domain
how exactly is this center defined? The location of the center would be
different if index pair (i,j) is associated with a node and with center of grid
cell. I will assume the latter, and also that the grid meant here is from
idfs:idfe,jdfs:jdfe.
