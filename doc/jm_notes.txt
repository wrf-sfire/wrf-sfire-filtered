atm grid variables
[in the order declared in subroutine cawfe]
! in
! 3D, DIMENSION( ims:ime,kms:kme,jms:jme ) 
!  u,v            incoming atmos. winds (m/s at arakawa-c grid locations)
!  z              height above sea level of mass points (m)
!  z_at_w         height above sea level of w points (m)
!  rho            incoming atmos. density (kg/m^3 at arakawa-c grid mass points) 
!  dz8w           delta z between w points (m)
! 2D, DIMENSION( ims:ime, jms:jme )
!  mu		  topography (m abv sealvl)
!  zs             height of surface above sea level (m)
! out
! 3D
!  rthfrten       theta tendency due to fire induced heat flux divergence
!  rqvfrten       Qv tendency due to fire induced moisture flux divergence
! 2D
!  grnhfx         heat flux from ground fire (W/m^2)
!  grnqfx         moisture flux from ground fire (W/m^2)
!  canhfx         heat flux from crown fire (W/m^2)
!  canqfx         moisture flux from crown fire (W/m^2)

grndhx,grndqx,canhx,canqx are temporaries only
not passing them to the driver makes no difference
removed from cawfe argument list
 


subroutine fire_winds: physics atm grid -> fire grid

subroutine fire_topography atm grid topo -> fire grid
subroutine fire_startup: separated into operations on fire only
subroutine fire_ln: got rid of extra atm args

6/13/07

subroutine fire_init: got rid of some extra atm args (its and so on)
        ditto fire_ds, fire_igs
nfrx, nfry: ratio atm/fire grid; no business in fire routines
        took out of fire_startup, fire_stat, fire_ln, fire_ds, fire_igs
