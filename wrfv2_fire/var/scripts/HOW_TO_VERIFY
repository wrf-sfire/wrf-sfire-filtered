                      =====================================

1, get_data_files.csh

   This shell is used to prepare the data files for testing verification 
   with WRFDA v3.0.1.1

   a) observation files for verification;
   b) the first guess files for filtering the observations;
   c) WRF forecast files for experiments.

2, da_run_suite_wrapper_qc_obs.ksh

   This shel script gave the filtered observation files: 

	${directory}/${time}/wrfvar/filtered_obs

3, da_run_suite_wrapper_verif_obs.ksh

   This shell script will generate the "gts_omb_oma" files for specific EXP
   and specific forecast time based on the filtered_obs and forecast files.
   The results are in

      ${REGION}/${EXPT}_H${VERIFY_HOUR}/(${time}+${VERIFY_HOUR})/wrfvar

   Note: before running this script, you should do 

      cp da_run_suite_verif_obs.ksh  ${WRFVAR_DIR}/var/scripts/.

4, da_run_wrapper_verif_obs_plot.ksh

   This shell script creates the verification plots for multiple experiments,
   which includes the i) vertical profile; ii) Time average; and iii) Time_series
   for ABIAS, BIAS, and RMSE.

   Before running this script, carefully edit it.

   da_run_wrapper_verif_obs_plot.ksh ==> da_verif_obs_plot.ksh

   Input files:"gts_omb_oma", could be from the normal WRFVar runs or VERIFY 
               runs 
     
      export GET_OMBOMA_PLOTS=false: only uses the omb part for verification against the obs
      export GET_OMBOMA_PLOTS=true : plot both omb and oma for normal WRFVar runs.

   Executable : da_verif_obs.exe

   Note: before running da_run_wrapper_verif_obs_plot.ksh, you should do

      cp da_verif_obs_plot.ksh    ${WRFVAR_DIR}/var/scripts/.
