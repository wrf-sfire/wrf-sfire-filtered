This file explains how to compile and run the NCEP cwordsh utility,
which is described in detail at
http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/toc/cwordsh/,
and whose usage is governed by the terms and conditions of the disclaimer
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.html

1.  If you haven't already done so, download, compile, and build the NCEP
    BUFRLIB software on the same system upon which you plan to run cwordsh.
    The BUFRLIB software is available via the web page
    http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/
    
2.  Set the environment variable BUFRLIB to point to the location of the
    compiled BUFRLIB archive library from step #1.

3.  Compile the source file "cwordsh.f" and link it to BUFRLIB in order
    to create the executable file "cwordsh.x".  In general, no special
    compiler flags are required, so something similar to the following:

    $FC -o cwordsh.x cwordsh.f $BUFRLIB

    where $FC points to the local FORTRAN 77 compiler, should suffice for
    most systems.
    
4.  Set the environment variable CWRD to point to the directory containing
    the compiled "cwordsh.x" executable from step #3.

5.  The script "cwordsh" will now run the "cwordsh.x" executable that was
    created in step #3.  The script takes three arguments, the first of which
    is the string "block" or "unblk", depending on whether the script is to
    be used to block or unblock a file, respectively.  The second argument
    is the input file to be blocked or unblocked, and the third argument is
    the name of the output file that is the final unblocked or blocked copy
    of the input file, depending on the case.
