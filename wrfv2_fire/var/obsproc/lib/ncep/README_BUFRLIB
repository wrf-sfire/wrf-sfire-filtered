This file explains how to compile the NCEP BUFRLIB software, which is
described in detail at http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/,
and whose usage is governed by the terms and conditions of the disclaimer
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.html

The NCEP BUFRLIB software has been compiled and tested across a wide variety
of UNIX platforms, including AIX 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX 9.x and 10.x, IRIX 6.x,
SunOS 5.x and RedHat Linux 5.2; thus, it should port with minimal difficulty
to any UNIX system.  In general, no special compiler flags are required,
and therefore the simple commands:

    $AC -c *.c
    $FC -c *.f

where $AC and $FC point to, respectively, the local ANSI C and FORTRAN 77
compilers, should suffice for most systems.  However, it is recommended to
then assemble all of the compiled object files into an archive library via:

    ar crv $BUFRLIB *.o

where $BUFRLIB points to the desired pathname for the BUFRLIB archive library.
This archive library can then be easily linked whenever the user's application
program is subsequently compiled on the same local system.


JFB additions  2/1/06

Need to run cpp on bufrlib.PRM as follows

/lib/cpp -I. -C -P -DLINUX -traditional -Dlinux bufrlib.PRM > bufrlib.prm

set -DSUPERSIZE to use large arrays.

compile C routines with cc -DUNDERSCORE if you are on a machine
which requires a trailing underscore to interface with Fortran.
See bufrlib.h for more info.
