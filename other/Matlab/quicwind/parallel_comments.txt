- Halo call will put values into halo regions
- For coarser grids, on each, we declare the coarse grids as local
- Pack all coarse grid boundary values into 1 additional halo layer
  (works for power of 2 grids)
- For not power of 2 grids, we do some coarsening (on boundary) by a
  factor of 3 (to ensure it fits)
- Looking ahead for parallelism, first step is to make it work on a single processor
