Matlab routines to visualized coupled model from files written by sfire

1. in phys/module_fr_sfire_driver.F activate the switch write_m
2. oneframe.m will read solution at one time from files and display
3. vc2d will create the movie (as uploaded on youtube)
   note: the values of k in vc2d must be from those dumped via write_m

Works as on Dec 30 2007 commit e89be70c3b1eb1b0c75dc4c02cdf96a66a06b026
